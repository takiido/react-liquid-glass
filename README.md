# React Liquid Glass Effect

A draggable, interactive glass distortion effect for React, built using **SVG filters and canvas displacement maps**.  
This library lets you add a smooth, "liquid-like" glass panel to your site with **no external dependencies** beyond React.

> **Inspired by:** [liquid-glass-js by dashersw](https://github.com/dashersw/liquid-glass-js)  
> Rewritten from scratch with a new architecture and codebase for originality.
